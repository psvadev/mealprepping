# CLAUDE.md — mealprepping

Browser-based weekly meal planner for a Norwegian family doing batch-cook meal prep. Single self-contained `index.html` — React 18 + Babel via CDN, no build step, served with `python3 -m http.server 8080`.

**Meal prep philosophy:** everything is cooked on one batch day, frozen in portions, and dinner is reheating and eating only — no per-dinner prep whatsoever. All AI prompts (suggestions, recipes, shopping list) enforce this strictly.

**Localisation:** the UI and all AI-generated content (suggestions, recipes, shopping lists) are in Norwegian bokmål. All three AI prompts begin with `Svar alltid på norsk bokmål.` to enforce this. The codebase itself is in English. There is no i18n layer — Norwegian is hardcoded throughout. Prompts also explicitly require common supermarket ingredient names (e.g. "løk" not "kepaløk", "kokosmelk" not "kokosmilk") to avoid confusion when the same ingredient appears under different names in the same recipe or shopping list.

## Architecture

- **No build step** — React 18 and Babel Standalone loaded from `unpkg.com` CDN. JSX transpiled in-browser via `<script type="text/babel">`.
- **All state in localStorage** — prefixed `mp_`. Initialized via lazy `useState(() => lsGet(...))`, persisted with individual `useEffect` hooks per state slice.
- **Anthropic API** — called directly from the browser using `fetch`. Requires `anthropic-dangerous-direct-browser-access: true` header to bypass CORS. Model: `claude-sonnet-4-6`.
- **Kassal API** — `kassal.app/api/v1/products` for real Norwegian grocery prices. Optional — falls back to AI price estimates if key is absent.
- **No backend** — everything runs client-side.

## Views

Four top-level views switched by `setView(...)`:

| View | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `plan` | Main view — weekly grid, suggestions, favourites, nutrition summary |
| `shopping` | Generated shopping list by category with total price estimate |
| `fryser` | Freezer tracker — logged batch-cook weeks, portion countdown, age warnings |
| `settings` | API keys, defaults, meal history, data import/export |

---

## Plan view

- **Weekly grid** — table of weeks × days. Cells show meal emoji, name, and a `ProteinBadge` pill. Click empty cell to enter "select mode" (amber highlight); click meal card to assign. Drag meal cards directly onto cells. All cells in a row share equal height regardless of content.
- **Drag and drop** — `draggable` on suggestion/favourite cards and on meals already in the grid. `onDragOver`/`onDrop` on grid cells. A `dragSource` state (`{week,day}` or `null`) distinguishes the two cases: dragging from the grid to another grid cell **swaps** the two meals; dragging from suggestions/favourites onto an occupied cell displaces the existing meal back to suggestions.
- **Plan modal** — clicking an assigned meal opens a detail modal with recipe, nutrition, price, and a notes textarea. Header includes a ★ favourite button (amber when active) to star/unstar the meal without leaving the modal. Separate 🗑 Fjern fra plan button prevents accidental deletion. Notes saved to `mp_mealNotes` on modal close. ESC closes the modal (saves notes first).
- **Suggestion modal** — clicking an expanded suggestion card opens a detail overlay. ESC closes it (priority over plan modal in the shared ESC handler).
- **Protein stats column** — rightmost grid column shows actual vs. target counts per protein type for each week.
- **Weekly nutrition summary** — shown below the grid for weeks where at least one meal has recipe data loaded. Summed from `mp_recipeCache` as 1 portion of each planned meal; updates automatically as recipes load. Label format: `NÆRING UKE N — 1 porsjon × M middager (ukestotal per person)`.
- **Load all recipes button** — "Last alle oppskrifter" appears above the nutrition summary when uncached planned meals exist. Calls `fetchAllRecipes()` which iterates unique planned meals and fetches each sequentially.
- **Progress bar** — filled days vs. total slots for active weeks.
- **Favourites panel** — toggled via ★ button. Shows starred meals as draggable chips; clicking one adds it back to the suggestion list.
- **Suggestion cards** — grid of AI-generated meals. Click to expand inline (full-width) showing name, cuisine, protein type, and prep time. Recipe is **not** fetched on expand — only fetched when opened via plan modal. Drag to grid or click in select mode to assign.
- **Filters** — filter suggestions by protein type. Applied client-side, no re-fetch.
- **Manual meal entry** — text input below the generate/clear buttons. Typing a meal name and pressing Enter or "Legg til" calls `addManualMeal()`, which makes a small Claude call (max_tokens: 256) to enrich the name into a full meal object (`name, emoji, protein, category, prepTime, description`). The enriched meal is prepended to `suggestions`. Falls back to defaults if the API call fails. Store-bought components (pizzabunn, tortillas, etc.) are explicitly allowed in the prompt.
- **"→ Fryser" button** — appears in the week label cell when the week has at least one non-leftover meal. Calls `addWeekToFreezer(week)`, which logs all non-leftover meals for that week to `mp_freezerItems` with `remaining = total = portions` and `cookedAt = today`, then navigates to the Fryser view.
- **"✕ Tøm" button** — clears the plan. Located beside the generate button in the suggestions panel (not in the nav bar).

---

## Fryser view

Freezer inventory for tracking batch-cooked portions.

**Data model** — each entry in `mp_freezerItems`:
```js
{ id, name, emoji, protein, remaining, total, cookedAt }
// id: `${Date.now()}-${name}` — unique key
// cookedAt: "YYYY-MM-DD" ISO string
```

**Layout:**
- Header: "🧊 Fryser" + green badge showing total active portions remaining. Tab label also shows active count.
- Items grouped by `cookedAt` date, most recent first. Date heading in Norwegian locale: `LAGET DD. MMMM YYYY`.
- Each item row: emoji + name + `ProteinBadge` + `remaining/total` counter with **−** / **+** buttons + **✕** remove.
- Depleted items (`remaining === 0`): 40% opacity, "Tomt" label replaces the −/+ controls.
- Items ≥ 90 days old: amber `⚠ Nd gammel` badge shown next to the protein pill; card border shifts to amber tint (`#4a3a1a`).
- "Tøm tomme" button (top-right) — removes all depleted items. Only shown when at least one item is depleted.
- Empty state message with instructions to use "→ Fryser" in the plan view.

**`addWeekToFreezer(week)`** — collects all non-null, non-leftover meals for the week, maps each to a freezer entry (`remaining = total = portions`), appends to `freezerItems`, then navigates to `"fryser"` view.

**Ratings** — 👍 / 👎 buttons appear on a Fryser item row once `remaining < total` (at least one portion eaten). 👍 adds the meal to `mp_favourites` (same object shape as suggestion cards) and removes it from `dislikedMeals`. 👎 adds the meal name to `mp_dislikedMeals` and removes it from favourites. The buttons toggle their border/background to show the active state. A "👎 Likt ikke" badge appears in the item's subtitle row when it's in the disliked list. `mp_dislikedMeals` is viewable and clearable per-item (or all at once) in Innstillinger → Liker ikke.

## AI calls

### Generate suggestions — `generateSuggestions()`
`POST /v1/messages` — returns `{ meals: [...] }`. Prompt includes:
- Protein targets per week (soft guidance)
- Cuisine targets per week (soft guidance)
- Max prep time (hard constraint)
- Exclusions / allergens — enforced on ingredient names, dish names, and inspiration sources (prevents "fårikål-inspirert" style workarounds)
- Already-planned meals (avoid repeats within current plan)
- Meal history (`mp_mealHistory`, last 30 entries) — avoids long-term repetition

### Fetch recipe — `fetchRecipe(meal)`
`POST /v1/messages` — returns `{ components: [{name, ingredients[]}], steps, nutrition, pricePerPortion?, tips? }`. Called when a plan modal is opened or via the "Last alle oppskrifter" button. **Not called on suggestion card expand** — recipe is only fetched when a meal is already in the plan. Result cached in `mp_recipeCache`. Prompt scales ingredients to the configured `portions` count; nutrition is always requested per 1 portion. AI always estimates `pricePerPortion`; Kassal overrides it if it finds at least 1 price match. Prompt includes the active unit system (metric: g/kg/dl/ml; imperial: oz/lbs/cups/fl oz). Prompt explicitly requests 1–3 batch/freeze tips (`tips` array) — how to pack and freeze the dish, and the best reheating method (oven, microwave, pan). Tips must not suggest any per-dinner prep or fresh components. Tips are displayed in the plan modal and in suggestion card expanded view when cached. Old cached recipes with flat `ingredients[]` still render correctly via a backward-compatible fallback in the modal.

### Generate shopping list — `generateShoppingList(force?)`
`POST /v1/messages` — returns `{ categories: [{name, emoji, items: [{name, amount}], price: {low, high}}], totalPrice: {low, high} }`. Each category includes a `price` range estimate shown in the UI. Only regenerates when `planKey` changes or `force=true`. `planKey` is a hash of planned meal names + portions. Prompt includes the active unit system. Regenerating also clears `checkedItems` for that week.

**Freezer-aware:** Before building the prompt, planned meals are cross-referenced against `freezerItems` by name (case-insensitive). Matches with `remaining > 0` inject a note: if `remaining >= portions`, the AI is told to skip that meal's ingredients entirely; if partial, it scales to `portions - remaining` new portions only.

**Store-bought components:** The prompt instructs the AI to list commonly pre-made components (pizzabunn, tortillas, butterdeig, etc.) as a single finished item rather than expanding into individual dough ingredients.

---

## Shopping view

- **Week tabs** — one tab per active week. Shows a `checkedCount/totalCount` amber fraction badge when any items are checked for that week.
- **Check-off** — each item `<li>` is clickable (`cursor: pointer`). Clicking toggles `checkedItems[week][catName|itemName]`. Checked items show name with `line-through`, dimmed color, and 55% opacity. Sub-items are hidden while the parent is checked.
- **"✕ Nullstill" button** — appears in the shopping header only when ≥1 item is checked for the current week. Clears all checked items for that week. Styled as a ghost/outline button matching the other header buttons.
- **Persistence** — `mp_checkedItems` persists in localStorage so check-off state survives page refresh. Cleared automatically when the list is regenerated for that week.
- **Freezer notice** — shown above the list when any planned meals are already in the freezer with `remaining > 0`. Single-sentence summary (e.g. "Kyllinggryte ligger allerede i fryseren og er ikke inkludert i listen."). When `allFrozen` (all planned meals covered by freezer), the "Har du dette hjemme?" pantry category and the total price estimate are hidden — the list is effectively empty and showing them would be misleading.

## Kassal price fetch — `fetchKassalPrice(ingredients)`

Picks up to 4 meaningful ingredients (skips salt, water, oil, etc.), strips amounts and adjectives, extracts the main noun word, searches `kassal.app/api/v1/products?search={word}&size=5`. Takes the minimum price found per ingredient, sums them, divides by `portions`. Returns `{low, high, source:"kassal"}` if ≥1 ingredient matched, otherwise `null`. Attached to `recipe.pricePerPortion` after recipe fetch, overriding the AI estimate.

**Hobby plan limits** — the free Kassal API tier allows 60 req/min, no commercial use, no support. Each recipe fetch makes up to 4 Kassal requests (one per meaningful ingredient). In normal use this is not a concern — a user would need to expand ~15 recipe cards within a single minute to approach the limit, which is unlikely. No rate-limit handling is implemented; if the limit is hit, `fetchKassalPrice` will return `null` and the app falls back to the AI price estimate silently. If usage grows, the only mitigation needed would be reducing the ingredient cap below 4 or adding a short delay between searches.

## Export / import

| Action | Implementation |
|--------|---------------|
| Export plan | Blob URL → `middagsplan-{date}.json`. Includes: `plan`, `weeks`, `portions`, `suggestions`, `proteinTargets`, `cuisineTargets`, `enabledCuisines`, `suggestionCount`, `maxTime`, `exclusions`, `units`, `shoppingLists`, `lastShoppingKeys`, `favourites`, `mealNotes`, `mealHistory`, `freezerItems`, `dislikedMeals`. Excludes: API keys and recipe cache (`mp_recipeCache` — recipes are re-fetched on demand). |
| Import plan | `FileReader` → JSON parse → restore state slices individually. API keys never imported. Recipe cache not included — re-fetched on demand. `freezerItems` and `dislikedMeals` restored if present. |
| Export shopping list | Blob URL → `handleliste.txt`. Plain text with category sections and price estimate. |
| Print / share | `window.open('','_blank')` → `document.write(html)`. Dark-theme page (matches app slate palette) with weekly grid + shopping list. `@media print` overrides to white-on-light for physical printing. Includes a Print button and a Lukk button; ESC also closes the popup window. **Note:** `<\/script>` must be escaped inside the JS template literal used to build the popup HTML — raw `</script>` terminates the outer Babel script block early and breaks the app. |

---

## Google Drive sync

Auto-saves to a single JSON file (`reheat-and-eat-backup.json`) in the user's Drive using OAuth PKCE flow with `drive.file` scope.

**Payload** — includes everything except API keys and OAuth tokens: `plan`, `weeks`, `portions`, `suggestions`, `proteinTargets`, `cuisineTargets`, `enabledCuisines`, `suggestionCount`, `maxTime`, `exclusions`, `units`, `shoppingLists`, `lastShoppingKeys`, `recipeCache`, `favourites`, `mealNotes`, `mealHistory`, `freezerItems`, `dislikedMeals`. Recipe cache is included so other devices don't need to re-fetch recipes.

**Auto-save** — triggered by a `useEffect` watching key state slices. Debounced 2 s to avoid saving mid-interaction. **Guard:** skips the save entirely if the plan contains no meals — prevents an accidental "Tøm plan" from overwriting the Drive backup with empty state.

**Load** — called once on startup if already connected, and after OAuth redirect completes. Manual pull button available in settings.

**Token lifecycle:**
- PKCE verifier stored in `localStorage` (not `sessionStorage`) to survive cross-origin redirects on mobile.
- `getValidAccessToken` refreshes the access token automatically using the stored refresh token.
- If the refresh returns `invalid_grant` (e.g. user revoked access externally), the token is cleared and `driveStatus` is set to `'expired'`. Callers detect the `'TOKEN_EXPIRED'` sentinel and show an amber reconnect prompt in settings.
- Disconnecting calls `https://oauth2.googleapis.com/revoke` to invalidate the token server-side before clearing localStorage.
- `connectGoogleDrive` uses `useCallback` with `[googleClientId, googleClientSecret]` as deps — both must be in the array or the callback captures stale empty strings and silently does nothing.

## Cuisines

`CUISINE_LIBRARY` contains 19 predefined cuisines (norsk, italiensk, asiatisk, meksikansk, indisk, japansk, kinesisk, thai, gresk, midtøsten, latinamerikansk, spansk, fransk, amerikansk, vietnamesisk, koreansk, tyrkisk, afrikansk, filippinsk). No free-text entry — all cuisines come from the library.

`enabledCuisines` (localStorage array of keys, default: the first 5) controls which appear in the Kjøkken panel. Active cuisines show their CuisineCounter + ✕ to disable. Inactive cuisines appear as dashed + chips below the active list. Disabling a cuisine also removes its target from `cuisineTargets`. `allCuisines` is derived via `useMemo` filtering `CUISINE_LIBRARY` by `enabledCuisines`.

---

## Meal history

Every meal assigned to the plan (via click, select mode, or drag) is added to `mp_mealHistory` (max 100 unique names, oldest dropped first). The last 30 entries are included in the suggestion prompt. Viewable and clearable in Innstillinger.

---

## Settings page

Sections:

1. **API-nøkler** — Anthropic (required) and Kassal (optional). Password inputs, stored immediately in localStorage on change. Never included in plan exports.
2. **Standardverdier** — weeks, portions, suggestion count, max time, and measurement units (Metrisk / Imperialt toggle). Switching units clears `mp_recipeCache` and `mp_shoppingLists` immediately, since AI-generated amounts are baked into the cached text. Changing portions calls `changePortions(n)` which also clears `recipeCache`, `shoppingLists`, and `lastShoppingKeys` — so re-fetched recipes reflect the new count.
3. **Mathistorikk** — scrollable list of recent meals, clear button.
4. **Liker ikke** — list of disliked meal names with per-item ✕ removal and a "Tøm liste" button. Empty state explains how to add entries (via 👎 in Fryser view).
5. **Data** — export plan, import plan, export shopping list, clear recipe cache, clear plan.
6. **Google Drive** — connect/disconnect button, last synced timestamp, manual pull button. Shows an amber "tilkoblingen er utløpt" warning when the token has expired (`driveStatus === 'expired'`), prompting reconnection.

---

## Units

`mp_units` — `"metric"` (default) or `"imperial"`. Toggled in Innstillinger → Standardverdier.

- **Metric**: g, kg, dl, ml, liter
- **Imperial**: oz, lbs, cups, fl oz, tbsp, tsp

The active unit is injected as a sentence into the `fetchRecipe` and `generateShoppingList` prompts. Because amounts are stored as free text in `mp_recipeCache` (e.g. `"500g kylling"`), switching units calls `changeUnits()` which resets `recipeCache`, `shoppingLists`, and `lastShoppingKeys` — forcing fresh AI calls in the new system. `changePortions(n)` does the same: ingredient amounts are scaled and baked into the cached text, so any portions change also clears those caches.

---

## Mobile layout

Breakpoint: `window.innerWidth < 640` — tracked in `isMobile` state with a `resize` listener.

**On mobile (< 640px):**
- Header controls row hidden entirely (UKE, PORSJONER, Proteinmål, Kjøkken, Maks tid, Skriv ut)
- Compact header padding (`12px 16px 10px`)
- Week selector shown in header when `weeks > 1` — buttons 1…N set `mobileWeek` (plan view) and `shoppingWeek` (shopping view) together
- Plan grid renders only the `mobileWeek` row instead of all weeks
- Bottom nav bar (`height: 56px`) with four tabs: Plan / Handleliste / Fryser / Innstillinger. Switching tabs closes any open plan or suggestion modal.
- Root div is `position: fixed; inset: 0; display: flex; flex-direction: column` — content scrolls inside a `flex: 1; overflow-y: auto` inner div; nav bar sits in normal flow at the bottom. This avoids iOS Safari's `position: fixed` scroll drift bug.
- No `zoom: 1.1`

**On desktop (≥ 640px):**
- Full header with all controls and top nav tabs
- All weeks rendered in the plan grid
- `zoom: 1.1` applied via `@media (min-width: 640px)`
- Bottom nav bar not rendered

---

## Styling

Dark neutral slate: `#0e0f11` background, `#18191c` cards, `#141517` inset areas, `#22232a`/`#2a2b30` borders.
Warm amber accent: `#e8a838` for active states, buttons, highlights.
Text: primary `#e4ddd0`, secondary `#b4b2c2`, muted `#747280`.
Font: `'Georgia', 'Times New Roman', serif` for headings/body; `sans-serif` for UI labels and data.
All layout via inline styles — no CSS classes except global resets and scrollbar styling.
Mobile friendly via `flexWrap`, `auto-fill` grid columns, and a dedicated mobile layout at `< 640px`.
`zoom: 1.1` is restricted to `@media (min-width: 640px)` — not applied on phones.
Plan grid uses `tableLayout: "fixed"` so all day columns stay equal width regardless of meal name length. `maxWidth` on the main container and header is 1400px to better utilise wide screens.
Grid rows use equal-height cells: `<td>` has `height: "1px"` (table layout trick meaning "fill the row") and the inner div uses `height: "100%"` so all cells in a row stretch to match the tallest.
Plan grid table has `minWidth: 560px` so it scrolls horizontally on narrow screens rather than squashing columns.
